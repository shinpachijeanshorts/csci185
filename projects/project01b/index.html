                        Hallucinations is a shot on video movie about three brothers left home alone while their mom is
                        stuck
                        working through the night. After one brother meets the nextdoor monk, the three begin to
                        experience
                        increasingly violent and deadly hallucinations. The film stars John Polonia, Mark Polonia, and
                        Todd
                        Michael Smith.
                        The three of them are also the directors, cinematographers, etc... <br>
                        Shot on video (SOV) films are films shot directly on consumer available camcorders. During the
                        80's,
                        many artists utilized these goods to film their own movies and distribute them to as many video
                        stores
                        as possible. Essentially, homemade movies were able to be mass produced and consumed by fellow
                        common
                        people. Horror was essentially the only genre prominent in this movement, as tons of creatives
                        would
                        film their own shock/horror films at home with no budget.<br> I was sucked in based on the cover
                        (to the right),
                        which has some pretty cool artwork.

                        The lack of a budget or acting ability is a prominent part of this film. Props are (in a way,
                        charmingly) handmade, imperfect things that are constructed out of household materials. It's
                        impossible
                        to have a scene with all three brothers, as one always has to be filming/directing. Any gore is
                        instantly cut away and returned to to avoid the need for mechanical effects. <br>
                        Despite this, there's a clear passion. Scenes where they try and portray throwing up organs (a
                        pink,
                        tied up t-shirt) or a bizarre worm creature stalks the shower (an old ribbed pipe with some clay
                        at
                        the
                        end). It's easy to have your nonexistent budget control your scene choices, but that doesn't
                        happen
                        here.

                        Objectively, this is a terrible film. The dialogue is hard to understand, the acting is
                        horrible,
                        the
                        props are cheap... And really, not much happens beyond continually weird hallucinations from the
                        brothers. Characters are nonexistent beyond the defining trait of one brother being adopted and
                        another
                        being mentally handicapped, and I can't remember a single name. There are some wins, though.
                        <br>
                        A film where passion is clearly put into it is more enjoyable than another lifeless straight to
                        DVD
                        piece of garbage. Even if scenes end up being corny, it's enjoyable to see three fans of horror
                        create
                        something they clearly care about. The music is also quite effective in being eerie. Scenes
                        where
                        things
                        would be objectively funny (a shaking clay human that looks nothing lifelike) end up so bizarre
                        that
                        you
                        get uncomfortable among music made from slowed down growing and dog whining.

                        For some reason, after I finished watching this film, it wouldn't leave my head. Not in a way
                        that reflected it had truly scared me, like some films of the past had. Frankly, I don't think
                        anything in this movie is objectively scary aside from concepts. I eventually realized, I was so
                        struck with this movie based on the love the brothers put into it.

                        I have a deep love for the homemade world of content. Be it something physically burned onto a
                        DVD, or posted just online. This film struck a sentimental chord in me, of people unafraid to
                        put themselves out there and make a pure passion project out of nothing but an adoration for
                        horror. I love when people create, regardless of experience or budget. Even if I tend to watch
                        those types of things for a kick of humor, it's out of a love for human creation. Creativity
                        stomps out objects blocking the production of something great, and this film really showcases
                        that if you <i>want</i> to make something - you should just do it.

                        I think this movie really stuck with me not just for its very existence, but for the absolute
                        absurdity of it. I enjoy art, but I wouldn't consider myself someone into avant-garde films or
                        anything insanely focused on form. There is something incredibly fascinating to me about bizarre artwork, that I think (at the risk of sounding like a hipster) it showcases human nature in a weird way (because isn't it in itself absurd that we even exist as a species?).<br>
                        This movie reminded me of what it means to create as a human, and the capabilities of weirdness we hide in our brains.

                        I've heard the term "weird for the sake of being weird" thrown around as an insult before, which
                        I despise! Weird artwork and videos are an opportunity for people to make whatever comes to
                        mind, to really showcase any creative thought in their brain. <br>
                        Primus' music video, right beside this panel, contains bizarre rubbery cowboys that have
                        absolutely nothing to do with what they're singing about.

                        Something I will forever adore about the internet is the fact I have access to all the weird
                        little things people feel like sharing, and I loathe the idea that one day people will be too
                        scared of embarrassing themselves to create.
