                        Hallucinations is a shot on video movie about three brothers left home alone while their mom is
                        stuck
                        working through the night. After one brother meets the nextdoor monk, the three begin to
                        experience
                        increasingly violent and deadly hallucinations. The film stars John Polonia, Mark Polonia, and
                        Todd
                        Michael Smith.
                        The three of them are also the directors, cinematographers, etc... <br>
                        Shot on video (SOV) films are films shot directly on consumer available camcorders. During the
                        80's,
                        many artists utilized these goods to film their own movies and distribute them to as many video
                        stores
                        as possible. Essentially, homemade movies were able to be mass produced and consumed by fellow
                        common
                        people. Horror was essentially the only genre prominent in this movement, as tons of creatives
                        would
                        film their own shock/horror films at home with no budget.

                        The lack of a budget or acting ability is a prominent part of this film. Props are (in a way,
                        charmingly) handmade, imperfect things that are constructed out of household materials. It's
                        impossible
                        to have a scene with all three brothers, as one always has to be filming/directing. Any gore is
                        instantly cut away and returned to to avoid the need for mechanical effects. <br>
                        Despite this, there's a clear passion. Scenes where they try and portray throwing up organs (a
                        pink,
                        tied up t-shirt) or a bizarre worm creature stalks the shower (an old ribbed pipe with some clay
                        at
                        the
                        end). It's easy to have your nonexistent budget control your scene choices, but that doesn't
                        happen
                        here.

                        Objectively, this is a terrible film. The dialogue is hard to understand, the acting is
                        horrible,
                        the
                        props are cheap... And really, not much happens beyond continually weird hallucinations from the
                        brothers. Characters are nonexistent beyond the defining trait of one brother being adopted and
                        another
                        being mentally handicapped, and I can't remember a single name. There are some wins, though.
                        <br>
                        A film where passion is clearly put into it is more enjoyable than another lifeless straight to
                        DVD
                        piece of garbage. Even if scenes end up being corny, it's enjoyable to see three fans of horror
                        create
                        something they clearly care about. The music is also quite effective in being eerie. Scenes
                        where
                        things
                        would be objectively funny (a shaking clay human that looks nothing lifelike) end up so bizarre
                        that
                        you
                        get uncomfortable among music made from slowed down growing and dog whining.
